 Hi, Iâ€™m Mariza Cooray!
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in how machine learning can be used to improve poverty targeting and working on such a project in Indonesia
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying pure mathematics at the Australian National University and I absolutely love it! I am studying to be a macroeconomist and hope to write a PhD. thesis someday on economic growth/income inequality/poverty
I'd be really keen to hear from anyone else modelling poverty or working on poverty prediction. Mail me on mariza.cooray@anu.edu.au if you have ideas on collaboration :beer: or research on poverty prediction models!
