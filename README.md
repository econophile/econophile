 Fellow Githubbers - Mariza here!
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in how machine learning can be used to improve poverty targeting and working on such a project in Indonesia :indonesia:
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying pure mathematics :green_heart::sweat_drops: at the Australian National University and I absolutely love it! 
I'd be really keen to hear from anyone else modelling poverty or working on poverty prediction. Feel free to email me on mariza.cooray@anu.edu.au if you have ideas :thought_balloon: on collaboration :beer: to work on poverty prediction models!
